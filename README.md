This is where I store my additions to `cgit`. I haven't sent them
upstream because they're ugly hacks.

github
------

This patch, stored in the `github` branch, adds a github tab to each
cgit page.

The configuration is pretty simple:

    enable_github_tab=1
    github_user=ausbin

See `cgitrc(5)` for more information.
